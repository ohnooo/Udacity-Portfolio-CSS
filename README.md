# Framework:
SASS SUSY 

# File Description:
SASS files:  root/site/sass

layout.cscc -> susy map:  setup 12 column

screen.cscc -> li element: set to column 4 example @include span(4) yields 33.333% width

# Note:
SASS uses ruby to compile cscc file to css file. I am able to control the compiler to make css to shorthand.
